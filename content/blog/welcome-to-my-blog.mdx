# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the structure and formatting of MDX files in our blog system.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a syntax that lets you write **JSX** in your *Markdown* documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write content using familiar Markdown syntax
- **Frontmatter**: Metadata in YAML format at the top of each file
- **Tags**: Organize your posts with tags
- **Date-based**: Automatic timestamping

### Code Example

Here's a simple code snippet:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Conclusion

This blog system provides a clean, organized way to create and manage blog content using MDX files with frontmatter metadata.
